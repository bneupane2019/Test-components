This is to check how combined gas power plant with HP performs with CHP
#initialization case
The input for both the technology is taken as 100kWh natural gas.In case of CHP, the plant is considered to have 50\% thermal efficiency and 40\% electrical efficiency. However, incase of GuD it is considered to have 60\% electrical efficiency and one-third of the electrical energy is consumed for a HP with COP of 4.
Both the technologies have reference temperature or ambient temperature of varying from (-10째C to 20) and demand temperature 30째C in first case and in the second case demand temperature varying from (20째C to 80째C).
